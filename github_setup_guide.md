# GitHub Repository Setup Guide for IRONWOOD

To properly store and collaborate on the IRONWOOD project, you'll need to create a GitHub repository and connect your local repository to it. Follow these steps:

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter "IRONWOOD" as the repository name
4. Add a description: "A futuristic dashboard for IoT-enabled medical facility management"
5. Choose the repository visibility (Public or Private)
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license since you already have these files locally
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository

After creating the repository, GitHub will show instructions for connecting an existing repository. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/IRONWOOD.git

# Verify the remote was added correctly
git remote -v

# Push your local repository to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## 3. Verify Repository Setup

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. Confirm all your files are now visible in the repository
3. Check that the commit history is intact

## 4. Set Up Branch Protection (Optional)

To enforce good development practices:

1. Go to Settings > Branches
2. Add a branch protection rule for the `master` branch
3. Enable options like "Require pull request reviews before merging"
4. Save changes

## 5. Start Using GitHub Issues

1. Go to the "Issues" tab
2. Create new issues for upcoming features using the templates
3. Assign labels and priorities
4. Follow the development workflow outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md

## 6. GitHub Actions (Future Enhancement)

Consider setting up GitHub Actions for:
- Automated testing
- Build verification
- Deployment processes

This can be configured in the `.github/workflows` directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to:
1. Use a personal access token instead of your password
2. Configure SSH authentication for more secure access
3. Use GitHub CLI or GitHub Desktop for simplified management
