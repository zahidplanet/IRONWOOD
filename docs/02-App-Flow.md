# IRONWOOD App Flow

The IRONWOOD platform consists of interconnected pages that form a cohesive digital experience across the medical campus.

## Login Page

The Login Page serves as the entry point where users authenticate based on their role. The system identifies whether the user is an owner, physician, or patient and directs them to their appropriate dashboard. Authentication relies on secure protocols with plans to implement biometric verification in the future.

## Owner Dashboard

The Owner Dashboard presents a comprehensive overview of the entire IRONWOOD campus. Upon login, owners immediately see critical KPIs including financial metrics, occupancy rates, and operational statistics. The main dashboard features interactive cards displaying real-time data from all connected IoT devices throughout the facility.

Owners can navigate to detailed views for financials, sales, HR, and projects through a persistent sidebar. Each section expands to show granular data with filtering options for time periods and categories.

- The financials section displays revenue streams, expenses, and profitability across all medical practices.
- The HR section shows staff information, scheduling, and performance metrics.
- The projects section tracks ongoing development, renovations, and expansion initiatives with progress indicators and timeline visualizations.

## Physician Dashboard

The Physician Dashboard provides practitioners with personalized performance metrics and patient management tools. After authentication, physicians see their individual practice data including patient volumes, procedure statistics, and revenue figures.

Interactive cards highlight conversion rates, patient feedback scores, and upcoming appointments. Physicians can access detailed patient records through a searchable interface, review medical histories, and see aggregated analytics about their practice performance.

The interface includes communication tools to interact with patients and other practitioners across the campus. Procedure-specific data allows physicians to track outcomes and identify trends in their practice. An alerts section notifies physicians of important events or changes in patient status.

## Patient Portal

The Patient Portal (currently a placeholder) will eventually become a comprehensive health management interface. The current implementation shows a "Coming Soon" message with the same glassmorphic design language used throughout the platform.

The future portal will allow patients to view their appointment history, access test results, communicate with physicians, and manage their health data. Patients will be able to opt into creating a digital twin that aggregates their health information from multiple providers within the IRONWOOD network.

Premium features will be available through a subscription model, offering enhanced services like 24/7 access to wellness facilities and advanced AI health assistant functionality.

## Navigation System

The Navigation System connects all pages through a persistent sidebar or header that adapts based on user role. The navigation includes clearly labeled icons and text for each major section, with the current location highlighted.

Transitions between pages feature smooth animations that maintain context and orientation. The system supports deep linking to specific sections and remembers user preferences and recent activities to streamline workflow.

## Settings and Profile Pages

The Settings and Profile Pages allow all users to manage their account information, communication preferences, and notification settings. These pages maintain consistent design language while offering role-specific options relevant to each user type.
